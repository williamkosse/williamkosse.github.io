          There was a guy named Edward who was lost after his parents died. He
          found solace in games and believed it was a great way to express
          himself. This passion led him to delve into the world of game design,
          where he created a character named Abi. Abi was Edward's alter ego, a
          reflection of his struggles and emotions. Through Abi, Edward told his
          own story and found a way to cope with his loss. Along the way, he
          learned about the character creation pipeline and what it takes to
          make a video game.

          Challenger Deep. I don’t really know who I am and where I come from.
          Mum and dad have been away for a while; there was a blinding light and
          they vanished. It’s dark here most of the time. I like it, I feel
          safe. I fend for myself. When I’m hungry my esca turns on, it faintly
          lights up my surroundings and my appetite disappears. As time passes,
          I can feel my body expanding, my esca shines brighter and I see
          further. Maybe it’ll help me find my parents."

          In my work, I explore my roots through the diverse landscapes of my
          homeland, Mauritius. I have sculpted Oiseau, a clay and metal creature
          inspired by dozens of extinct birds that were once native to the
          Mascarenhas Archipelago. Due to the region's geographic location and
          centuries of colonialism, my artwork pays tribute to the ethnic and
          cultural diversity of the Mauritian people. <br /><br />Through the
          gaze of this hybrid creature he visits the stories of colonialism,
          immigration and exploitation. he accompanying soundscape captures the
          relentless pain and exhaustion endured by African, Malagasy, and
          Indian slaves. It tells a story of human perseverance and triumph in
          the face of adversity.

          "Weather Fields" investigates listening as a design practice to
          enhance our understanding of the rapidly changing ecology and human
          geographies. By listening to weather patterns and landscapes at
          different scales, designers can move beyond fixed approaches and adopt
          a more active mode. Through research and experimentation, methods have
          been developed to record and interpret sounds, which can be used to
          construct climate-related imaginaries and sonic world building.

          Snow moves through the air as it forms itself around particles in the
          atmosphere. It drags itself to the ground, shifting our perception
          from an innocent, romanticized symbol of beauty to a dangerous,
          suffocating and cold blanket. Through field recordings made on Rila
          mountain in Bulgaria, this sound piece explores the body moving
          through snow and snow moving through the environment. In that, it
          portrays how transporting yourself up a mountain is a simultaneous
          reversed experience of how snow travels down that mountain.

          Imagine hills and valleys. Imagine variety of terrain, rocks and
          fallen logs. Imagine being able to freely choose your path through
          this environment of hollers which regulate your manoeuvring? What does
          it mean for humans to live in an environment regulated by a
          rectangular grid? What does it mean to grow up in a city in which you
          can freely move in approximately 15% of its surface? How can we combat
          the feeling of artificiality in a heavily surveilled urban space
          through play and make it an inclusive and illuminating experience? In
          general, games are critically important in establishing healthy social
          interactions, and failing to play them can result in inappropriate
          aggression, anxiety and social isolation. Play can act as a release
          valve that allows people to feel a sense of their own agency, and to
          make some kind of sense of their experiences on their own terms. When
          are playgrounds for children going to start to resemble concrete urban
          landscapes? Why should we pay more attention to the signs of the
          inevitable need of play in the urban space? Because maybe through
          examining this act of freedom, we can learn more about being free.

          Drawing inspiration from the DIY Sound System movement, I constructed
          a unique subwoofer and metal horn that are designed to emphasise the
          intrinsic tonal qualities of sound. However, the shape and form of
          these components play an equally important role in shaping the sound
          that is heard. The subwoofer's narrow but defined sound spectrum is
          due to its design, which is intentionally poor in some respects. This
          design choice brightens up specific frequencies while muffling others,
          resulting in a distinctive and unusual sound that is unlike anything
          produced by a conventional sound system. Meanwhile, the metal horn's
          shape has been carefully chosen to enlarge the sound's soundscape. The
          material used to construct the horn also plays a crucial role in
          shaping the sound, creating a unique resonating timbre. The way a
          speaker is constructed affects the sound it produces, much like how
          our upbringing shapes our personalities.

          place between 2013 and 2018, providing a concentrated representation
          of where these incidents tend to occur. The aim is to generate
          conversations and initiatives regarding gun violence in these specific
          areas. This website includes partial data extracted from

            I think you're right. I've never have ever told you how much I
            appreciated you putting food on the table. But, it's not because I
            don't like your food. And, certainly it's not because I don't like
            to have you cooking the food for me and the boys, so you see
            Hopsing, I'd be lost without you. You're like my shadow in the
            afternoon, when I'm hungry and my shadow is long, you're there,
            right behind me taking care of me, and you know what? I've never
            thanked my shadow.

          The project is a book that explores my emotional response to George
          Bataille's "Histoire de l'œil". Through a secret language, I reflect
          on the taboo and secretive nature of the book and how secret messages
          were historically transmitted, such as through Morse code. I also
          created a new secret language to communicate with others and present
          Morse code as a language that could be revitalized. The book takes
          shape through multiple steps. In the first step, I created my own
          interpretation of Morse code, where each letter corresponds to a
          specific frequency played for a certain amount of time. Next, I
          created sound pieces based on this Morse code interpretation.
          Listeners were then given a pen and paper to represent the sounds they
          heard, resulting in an analog representation of cymatics. Through this
          project, I wanted to highlight the importance of understanding the
          stories behind sound and how they can be used to communicate in a way
          that is meaningful and intentional. Ultimately, my book seeks to
          inspire readers to engage with sound in a new way and appreciate the
          power of non-spoken languages in communication.
