              In the initial iteration of this book, where the text was typeset
              using a Compugraphic machine, an unusual phenomenon occurred: the
              words would seemingly vanish under the heat and humidity of
              summer. However, a significant transformation took place in 1975
              when "Behind the State Capitol" was re-imagined and retyped on an
              IBM machine. This process gave rise to a captivating narrative
              within the text, as grammatical, lexical, and formatting mishaps
              emerged. These unintentional errors added an intriguing layer to
              the overall composition.

              The revised publication serves a specific purpose: to explore and
              comprehend the limitations of modern technologies and their
              influence on our understanding. It delves into the realm of
              language compression tools, envisioning the text as a blurry JPEG
              representation of all the information. Similar to how a JPEG
              retains much of the essence of a higher-resolution image, this
              representation retains much of the information available. However,
              it is important to note that if one seeks an exact sequence of
              bits, they will only find an approximation. To further push the
              boundaries of this exploration, the text has undergone
              lemmatisation-a process that reduces words to their base or root
              form. However, the focus is placed on words not present in the
              Celex dictionary, allowing an exploration of their orthography,
              phonology, morphology, and syntax. By highlighting these unique
              linguistic elements, the book encourages readers to engage with a
              more nuanced understanding of language and its diverse forms.

              This revision of "Behind the State Capitol" engages with the
              interplay between technology, language, and perception. It
              challenges readers to question the boundaries and expectations set
              by conventional forms of communication and invites them to delve
              into the richness and complexity of linguistic expression.

              ‘Weather Fields’ investigates listening as a design practice to
              enhance our understanding of the rapidly changing ecology and
              human geographies. By listening to weather patterns and landscapes
              at different scales, designers can move beyond fixed approaches
              and adopt a more active mode. Through research and
              experimentation, methods have been developed to record and
              interpret sounds, which can be used to construct climate-related
              imaginaries and sonic world building.

              There was a man named Edward who was lost after his parents died.
              He found solace in games and believed it was a great way to
              express himself. This passion led him to delve into the world of
              game design, where he created a character named Abi. Abi was
              Edward's alter ego, a reflection of his struggles and emotions.
              Through Abi, Edward told his own story and found a way to cope
              with his loss. Along the way, he learned about the character
              creation pipeline and what it takes to make a video game.

              "My story begins at the dawn of time. My name is Abi and I live in
              the Challenger Deep. I don’t really know who I am and where I come
              from. Mum and dad have been away for a while; there was a blinding
              light and they vanished. It’s dark here most of the time. I like
              it, I feel safe. I fend for myself. When I’m hungry my esca turns
              on, it faintly lights up my surroundings and my appetite
              disappears. As time passes, I can feel my body expanding, my esca
              shines brighter and I see further. Maybe it’ll help me find my
              parents."

              Imagine hills and valleys. Imagine variety of terrain, rocks and
              fallen logs. Imagine being able to freely choose your path through
              this environment of hollers which regulate your manoeuvring?
            </p>

            <p>
              What does it mean for humans to live in an environment regulated
              by a rectangular grid? What does it mean to grow up in a city in
              which you can freely move in approximately 15% of its surface? How
              can we combat the feeling of artificiality in a heavily surveilled
              urban space through play and make it an inclusive and illuminating
              experience?
            </p>

            <p>
              In general, games are critically important in establishing healthy
              social interactions, and failing to play them can result in
              inappropriate aggression, anxiety and social isolation. Play can
              act as a release valve that allows people to feel a sense of their
              own agency, and to make some kind of sense of their experiences on
              their own terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              When are playgrounds for children going to start to resemble
              concrete urban landscapes? Why should we pay more attention to the
              signs of the inevitable need of play in the urban space?
            </p>

            <p>
              Because maybe through examining this act of freedom, we can learn
              more about being free.

            <p>
              Drawing inspiration from the DIY Sound System movement, I
              constructed a unique subwoofer and metal horn that are designed to
              emphasise the intrinsic tonal qualities of sound. However, the
              shape and form of these components play an equally important role
              in shaping the sound that is heard.
            </p>

            <p>
              The subwoofer's narrow but defined sound spectrum is due to its
              design, which is intentionally poor in some respects. This design
              choice brightens up specific frequencies while muffling others,
              resulting in a distinctive and unusual sound that is unlike
              anything produced by a conventional sound system. Meanwhile, the
              metal horn's shape has been carefully chosen to enlarge the
              sound's soundscape. The material used to construct the horn also
              plays a crucial role in shaping the sound, creating a unique
              resonating timbre.
            </p>

            <p>
              The way a speaker is constructed affects the sound it produces,
              much like how our upbringing shapes our personalities.

              The small game I've developed is an interactive, text-based game
              that is based on real-life interactions. game is based on
              real-life interactions that feel like you're talking to a
              non-playable character While players may feel like they have
              control over the narrative at first, the game is intentionally
              designed to throw them off guard with unexpected twists and turns.

              On a splendid summer day I took my snail on a walk. Come to find
              out I left my feet at the crib to iron the dishes because the
              grass was blue, blue like the ocean. Remember when I mopped the
              ocean? Come to find out I had to take my grandma to the vet
              because the cat was barking?

              Well, okay. Let me see here's the way I feel. I remember Pandorosa
              episode I don't know is 60, 63. Paul came home, long day on the
              ranch. Paul was mad. The boys weren't home. The boys were going to
              be mad when they got home. And Paul, he likes to feel responsible.
              And he said to Hopsing: “Hopsing, how come you don't even have
              dinner ready to be put on the table?” And Hopsing said: “You
              never, ever thanked me for making dinner.” Paul was flabbergasted.
              He thought about it, and she was right. He never, ever told
              Hopsing how much he enjoyed the food that she put on the table for
              him and the boys. And he said, Hopsing, I'm flabbergasted. I think
              you're right. I've never have ever told you how much I appreciated
              you putting food on the table. But, it's not because I don't like
              your food. And, certainly it's not because I don't like to have
              you cooking the food for me and the boys, so you see Hopsing, I'd
              be lost without you. You're like my shadow in the afternoon, when
              I'm hungry and my shadow is long, you're there, right behind me
              taking care of me, and you know what? I've never thanked my
              shadow.

            In my work, I explore my roots through the diverse landscapes of my
            homeland, Mauritius. I have sculpted Oiseau, a clay and metal
            creature inspired by dozens of extinct birds that were once native
            to the Mascarenhas Archipelago. Due to the region's geographic
            location and centuries of colonialism, my artwork pays tribute to
            the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Mauritian people.

            Through the gaze of this hybrid creature he visits the stories of
            colonialism, immigration and exploitation. he accompanying
            soundscape captures the relentless pain and exhaustion endured by
            African, Malagasy, and Indian slaves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, my artwork tells a story of human perseverance and
            triumph in the face of adversity.

              The project is a book that explores my emotional response to
              George Bataille's "Histoire de l'œil" through a secret language. I
              reflect on the taboo and secretive nature of the book and how
              secret messages were historically transmitted, such as through
              Morse code. I also created a new secret language to communicate
              with others and present Morse code as a language that could be
              revitalized.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book takes shape through multiple steps. In the first step, I
              created my own interpretation of Morse code, where each letter
              corresponds to a specific frequency played for a certain amount of
              time. Next, I created sound pieces based on this Morse code
              interpretation. Listeners were then given a pen and paper to
              represent the sounds they heard, resulting in an analog
              representation of cymatics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this project, I wanted to highlight the importance of
              understanding the stories behind sound and how they can be used to
              communicate in a way that is meaningful and intentional.
              Ultimately, my book seeks to inspire readers to engage with sound
              in a new way and appreciate the power of non-spoken languages in
              communication.
